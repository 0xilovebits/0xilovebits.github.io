This challenge, titled **Perfect Pair**, was part of the **[Arab Security Cyber Wargames 2025](https://www.ascyberwargames.com/){:target="_blank"}**.  
It was a mobile reverse engineering challenge involving an Android APK.

## üîç Static Analysis

After Downloading the APK, the first step was to open it in [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx){:target="_blank"} to explore its contents. I headed straight to the `AndroidManifest.xml` to identify the app entry point

![AndroidManifest Entry Point](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/manifest-entrypoint.png)

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px; color: #666;">
AndroidManifest.xml showing the application entry point.
</p>


While exploring the decompiled code, I noticed that the app was compiled using the [Jetpack Compose Compiler](https://developer.android.com/compose){:target="_blank"} ‚Äî Google modern declarative UI toolkit for building native Android apps faster and more easily.

This made the static analysis noticeably harder. Unlike traditional Android apps that use XML layouts and standard activity flows, Compose-based apps generate a lot of synthetic and compiler-generated classes and methods. These often result in unreadable or abstract bytecode when decompiled, which makes it tricky to trace UI logic or flow between screens using tools like JADX alone.

The entry point, `asc.wargames.perfectpair.MainActivity`, is where our journey begins.  
Inside its `onCreate()` method, the app sets its UI content using Jetpack Compose:

```java
ComponentActivity2.setContent$default(
    this,
    null,
    ComposableSingletons$MainActivityKt.INSTANCE.m6401getLambda3$app_debug(),
    1,
    null
);
```
This leads us down a rabbit hole of generated singleton classes. The call goes to `getLambda3$app_debug`, which in turn calls `getLambda2$app_debug`, then `getLambda1$app_debug`, and finally, this chain invokes the core navigation setup method: `MainActivityKt.PerfectPairNavHost()`. This chaining is a typical pattern for how the Compose compiler wires things up behind the scenes.

![Navigation Setup Method](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/navhost.png)
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px; color: #666;">
navigation setup method
</p>

This gives us a complete blueprint of the app's structure:

- welcome
- register
- login
- mainmenu
- download
- upload
- flag

An interesting observation here is that while routes like `upload` and `flag` are clearly defined, they aren't directly accessible from the main user interface flow. After logging in, the user is taken to the `mainmenu`, which only seems to offer two visible buttons: **"Download"** (leading to the `download` screen **Download firmware_v2.bin**) and **"Logout"** (which presumably calls the `logout` route to end the session).

Now that the app structure is clear and the main accessible routes are identified, it time to analyze the most intriguing part ‚Äî the `flag` activity üîç.
The `upload` route will be analyzed later, after confirming the behavior of the `flag` activity.

![Navigation Setup Method](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/flag_activity.png)
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px; color: #666;">
Flag Activity
</p>

Upon inspecting the `FlagActivity`, it turns out there nothing useful or interesting happening directly within it However, scrolling further through the code reveals a method near the end named `redirectToRealFlagActivity()`.

This method doesnt contain any validation or complex logic ‚Äî it simply launches another activity called `RealFlagActivity`.

That where things might get more interesting.

So, let move on and see what inside `RealFlagActivity` üëÄ.

![RealFlagActivity UI](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/real_flag_activity.png)
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px; color: #666;">
RealFlagActivity
</p>

Right under the cato image there a method called `secretSignature` that takes two byte arrays: `data` and `key`. It sets up an HMAC using `HmacSHA256` like this:

```java
private final String secretSignature(byte[] data, byte[] key) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
    new SecretKeySpec(key, "HmacSHA256");
    return "";
}
```

At first glance, it seems important ‚Äî maybe it was supposed to verify something or generate a secure value ‚Äî but after searching through the entire codebase, it turns out the method is never actually used.

It might just be a leftover, or maybe a decoy. Either way, its not something we need to worry about for now.

Also, that cat image might be a hint for something well discover later. But from a code perspective, there nothing functional happening in either `FlagActivity` or `RealFlagActivity`.

So lets move on and dig into what happening inside `upload` activity.

After digging into the functionality of `upload` activity, I found that it allows the user to select a firmware file ‚Äî similar to what happens in the download flow ‚Äî and then uploads it to the server.

![Upload Firmware Method](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/upload_firmware.png)
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px; color: #666;">
Upload Firmware Method
</p>

While tracing the upload logic, I noticed there a **Response Interceptor** hooked into the network layer. This interceptor listens to the server response and ‚Äî surprise ‚Äî that where the flag is returned!

![Response Interceptor Method](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/response_interceptor.png)
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px; color: #666;">
Response Interceptor Method
</p>

So now its clear: the server is expecting a specific firmware file. If we upload the right one, it sends back the flag in the response.

Time to figure out what that expected firmware looks like.  

At this point, I couldnt find anything else interesting in the code itself, so I thought ‚Äî maybe there something useful hidden in the `resources`.

And bingo! I spotted a native library bundled inside: `liblibsign.so`.

And‚Ä¶ its *not* used anywhere in the app.

Now *that* raised some eyebrows.

Looks like the developer left behind something they really shouldn't  have. Either they forgot to strip it out‚Ä¶ or they didnt realize how revealing it might be. Either way, were not complaining üòè

Lets crack it open in IDA Pro and see what secrets its hiding.

The first thing I always check when opening a native library is the list of **exported functions** ‚Äî they usually give a quick overview of what the library is meant to do.

![Exports From ida Pro](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/ida_exports.png)
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px; color: #666;">
Exports From ida Pro
</p>

And from the look of it‚Ä¶ there are some **very interesting functions** & **Secrets** here üëÄ

Let‚Äôs analyze this and see what the developer accidentally left for us.

First, let‚Äôs take a quick look at the **SECRET_KEY** Export.

![SECRET_KEY](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/secret_keys.png)

Looks like there are a few keys here that might come in handy later.

Now let‚Äôs check out the `Java_asc_wargames_perfectpair_NativeLib_getKey` function.

![GetKeyFunc](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/getKeyfunc.png)


This one returns a key `0x42` (66 decimal) ‚Äî maybe its used in an XOR or something similar.

Next up, the function that really caught my eye is `Java_asc_wargames_perfectpair_NativeLib_processData`. The name suggests it‚Äôs pretty important, so let‚Äôs dive into it.

![processDatafunc](/images/2025-08-01-perfect-pair/processDatafunc.png)

From a quick look, this function reads the input byte array, XORs each byte with values derived from `secret_keys`, and returns a new byte array. The way the key is accessed and applied hints that this function might be handling decryption or data transformation. Let‚Äôs break it down.

What is the key calculated by **(&secret_keys + loop_counter % 4 - 6543)**?

The `secret_keys` symbol points to:
.got.plt:0000202C secret_keys     dd offset stru_1F5C

Now let‚Äôs assume `loop_counter` is 0.

Then the calculation becomes:
(0x202C + 0 % 4 - 6543) = 0x69D

Address `0x69D` corresponds to:
.rodata:0000069D aMeow           db 'meow',0

So, it reads 4 bytes from this address ‚Äî meaning the key used here is `"meow"`.

## Lets Play With the Firmware!

Now that I have collected two interesting keys:

- `66` (from `getKey()`)
- `"meow"` (from the secret memory location)

I had a strong hunch that the function `processData()` in the native library is responsible for **firmware encryption**.

So, let‚Äôs test this out!

### XOR with Key `66`

I tried to XOR-decrypt the downloaded firmware using the key `66`.

And guess what? It worked!
The result looked like this:
```
USERNAME=_______________
TEAM_ID=0000
DATA=SMARTLOCK_FIRMWARE
SIGNATURE=________________________________
```

Now things are making more sense!

We can now confidently say:
- **Firmware encryption key = `66`**
-  there is a  `SIGNATURE` field‚Ä¶ and we just so happen to have another key (`"meow"`) left unused‚Ä¶

Hmm‚Ä¶ where have we seen `meow` before?

Right! Back in `RealFlagActivity`, under the cat image, there was a function called `secretSignature`. It takes `data` and `key`, and uses HMAC-SHA256.

Looks like we‚Äôve just cracked the full flow!

---

## Final Conclusion

Let‚Äôs sum it up:

- `processData()` encrypts/decrypts firmware with XOR using key `66`.
- `SIGNATURE` is generated via `HMAC-SHA256` using key `"meow"` (from memory address `0x69D`).
- The cat image + the unused `secretSignature()` were actually **important hints**.

## Let‚Äôs automate this!

write python script to genreate firmware

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

SIGN_KEY = b"meow"
XOR_KEY = 66
USERNAME = "ilovebits_ahmed"
TEAM_ID = "0007"
firmware_content = f"""USERNAME={USERNAME}
TEAM_ID={TEAM_ID}
DATA=SMARTLOCK_FIRMWARE
""".replace("\n", "\r\n")
signature = hmac.new(SIGN_KEY, firmware_content.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
final_firmware = firmware_content + f"SIGNATURE={signature}\r\n"
encoded_bytes = bytes([b ^ XOR_KEY for b in final_firmware.encode()])
with open("patched_firmware.bin", "wb") as f:
    f.write(encoded_bytes)

print("[+] Firmware patched and saved.")


```

and the script to  upload the patched firmware
```python
import requests
import os

BASE_URL = "http://34.136.125.67:5000"


def upload_firmware(jwt_token: str, file_path: str):
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        return {"error": f"File not found at {file_path}"}
    url = f"{BASE_URL}/api/firmware"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {jwt_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream",
    }

    print(f"Uploading firmware to: {url}")
    print(f"File size: {os.path.getsize(file_path)} bytes")

    try:
        with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
            file_data = f.read()
            response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=file_data, timeout=30)
        print(f"Upload successful (Code: {response.status_code})")
        return response.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return {"error": str(e)}


if __name__ == "__main__":
    jwt = "account_jwt"
    patched_firmware = "patched_firmware.bin"
    result = upload_firmware(jwt_token=jwt, file_path=patched_firmware)
    print("\n--- Server Response ---")
    if result:
        print(result)

```


let‚Äôs run this

And with that, the server responded with the flag! A super fun challenge that required connecting dots from the Java layer, native code, and even subtle hints in the UI.
