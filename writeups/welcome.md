# Welcome, Hackers and Learners!  

Hello and welcome to my blog!  
This space is where Iâ€™ll share my journey into **Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, and Low-Level Programming**.

---

## About Me  
$ **whoami** â†’ `0xilovebits`  
I'm a self-taught reverse engineer from Egypt who loves **low-level puzzles**, exploring how systems work under the hood, and sharing everything I learn.  
ðŸ§  *Always learning. Always reversing. Always sharing.*

## What to Expect  
Iâ€™ll be posting about:  
- **Reverse Engineering** tips and writeups.  
- **Malware Analysis** case studies.  
- **Low-level coding** (C, Assembly, (Zig & Pascal)(Soon) ).  
- **Technical projects** like emulators and tools.  

## â€¦just as soon as I stop reverse engineering my own life ðŸ¤¯

## Closing Thoughts  
This blog is my personal lab notebook. Expect **writeups**, **deep dives**, and **behind-the-scenes** explorations of software internals.  

Stay tunedâ€”more content is coming soon!
