# Welcome, Hackers and Learners!  

Hello and welcome to my blog!  
This space is where I’ll share my journey into **Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, and Low-Level Programming**.

## About Me  
$ **whoami** → `0xilovebits`  
I'm a self-taught reverse engineer from Egypt who loves **low-level puzzles**, exploring how systems work under the hood, and sharing everything I learn.  
🧠 *Always learning. Always reversing. Always sharing.*

## What to Expect  
I’ll be posting about:  
- **Reverse Engineering** tips and writeups.  
- **Malware Analysis** case studies.  
- **Low-level coding** (C, Assembly, (Zig & Pascal)(Soon) ).  
- **Technical projects** like emulators and tools.  

## …just as soon as I stop reverse engineering my own life 🤯
